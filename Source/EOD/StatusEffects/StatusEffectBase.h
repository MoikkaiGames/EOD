/**
 * The base abstract class for status effects
 * 
 * @note The status effect class is not analogous to in-game status effects. Think of this class as the status effects manager class, which
 * has the ability to manage the behavior and state of one particular type of status effect for a particular owner. For example, an object
 * of BleedStatusEffect class will simply manage the status effects of 'bleed' type that are triggered by its owner.
 * 
 * Initialize() must be right after any of the status effect class is instantiated. Failing to do so will throw a runtime error.
 * Initialize() would set up any prerequisites for the class. Similarly, Deinitialize() must be called right before the status effect's
 * object is destroyed.
 * 
 * The status effect object will persist in memory as long as the instigator persists. e.g., if a weapon with elemental enchant has been
 * equipped by player, the elemental status effect object will persist in memory as long as the weapon is equipped by player and must be
 * destroyed when the weapon is unequipped.
